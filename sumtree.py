Check if a given binary tree is SumTree - GeeksforGeeks

Write a function that returns True if the given binary tree is a SumTree or 
False if it is not. A SumTree is a binary tree where the value of each node is 
equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left and right subtrees. An empty
tree is a SumTree, and the sum of an empty tree is considered to be 0. A leaf 
node is also considered a SumTree.

Example:

        26
       /  \
      10   3
     /  \   \
    4    6   3
